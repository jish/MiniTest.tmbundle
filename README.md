## MinitTest bundle

The MiniTest bundle is currently focusing on the spec snippets, since the assert snippets are already included in the default Ruby bundle.

### Installation

Right now, you can install the MiniTest bundle using git:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/jish/MiniTest.tmbundle.git

Don't forget to reload your bundles. From the TextMate Menus select Bundles > Bundle Editor > Reload Bundles
