## MiniTest TextMate bundle

This is a bundle of snippets for [TextMate][1].

The MiniTest bundle is currently focusing on the spec snippets, since the assert snippets are already included in the default Ruby bundle.

### Installation

You can install this bundle locally by cloning it into the `Application Support/Avian` directory:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles
    git clone https://github.com/jish/MiniTest.tmbundle.git

Reloading bundles is not necessary with [TextMate 2][1]
